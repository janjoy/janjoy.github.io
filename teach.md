### Teaching Philosophy
Teaching has always given me a sense of joy and all the experiences I have had have enriched me with memories that are very dear to me. Be it elementary or graduate classroom I have always relished the challenge of articulating concepts in a clear and concise way. My teaching philosophy is based on the approach that learning should be fun and motivating. Teaching is a two way process- you not only impart knowledge but you also learn through the experience. My mentors have played a critical part to help me get where I am today, so I owe it to them to act as a mentor for the next generation.
