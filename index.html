I am currently a graduate student at <a href='https://education.scripps.edu/graduate/about-the-graduate-school/'>The Scripps Research Institute</a>, where I work with my advisor <a href='https://twitter.com/andrewsu'>Dr. Andrew Su</a>, exploring bioinformatic strategies for computational drug repurposing approaches. My research interests are broadly in computational genomics and transcriptomics, with a focus on RNAseq analysis.
