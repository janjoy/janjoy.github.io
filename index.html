I am currently a graduate student at <a href='https://education.scripps.edu/graduate/about-the-graduate-school/'>The Scripps Research Institute</a>, where I work with my advisor <a href='https://twitter.com/andrewsu'>Dr. Andrew Su</a>, exploring bioinformatic strategies for computational drug repurposing approaches. My research interests are broadly in computational genomics and transcriptomics, with a focus on RNAseq analysis.

Previously, I did my Masters in Physics from <a href='https://nitc.ac.in/'>National Institute of Technology, Calicut, India</a> and my Bachelors in Physics from <a href='https://www.ststephens.edu/'>St. Stephen's College, New Delhi, India</a>.

I love playing the Ukulele, growing a mini-garden and going on long strolls on the beach (perks of living in Sunny San Diego!)
